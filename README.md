# odin-mini-message-board

## Description
In this project a message board has been implemented in Javascript with node, and using PostgreSQL as the database.
The project has been deployed using railway: https://odin-mini-message-board-production-e0a7.up.railway.app/
It has been very fun to work on this project using both Javascript to deal with HTML and the database.
## Challenges
The most difficult challenge in this project has been dealing with the environment variables. Using dotenv only for the dev environment and not in deployment is not, at the moment of writing, second nature.
## Dependencies
Production:
- Express
- ejs
- Express validator (express-validator)
- node-postgres (pg)
Dev:
- dotenv
